# AVL Tree Implementation for Sale Records

## Overview

This Java program implements an AVL tree for storing SaleRecord objects based on their dates. The AVL tree ensures balanced insertion and efficient search operations. Each node in the tree represents a SaleRecord, and the tree is balanced to optimize the search, insertion, and deletion operations.

## Features

- **AVL Tree**: Implements a self-balancing AVL tree to efficiently manage SaleRecord objects.
- **Date Comparison**: Utilizes date comparison logic to order SaleRecord objects within the tree.
- **Balancing**: Automatically rebalances the tree after insertion to maintain its balanced nature.
- **Preorder Traversal**: Provides a preorder traversal function to print the SaleRecord nodes.
